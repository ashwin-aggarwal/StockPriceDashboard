# Extra Features Beyond Core Requirements

## Core Requirements Completed ✅
- Stock data table with symbol, price, % change
- Tailwind CSS responsive styling
- Finnhub API integration
- Production-ready for deployment

## Additional Features Implemented

This project significantly exceeds the minimum requirements by implementing all five suggested "nice-to-have" features plus several extras. The dashboard includes comprehensive loading states with per-tile spinners and skeleton loaders, robust error handling with retry functionality and graceful fallbacks, advanced search functionality that filters by both symbol and company name, multi-column sorting with three-state toggling (ascending/descending/none), and an Open→Current price visualization chart with axes and grid lines. Beyond these, I added an interactive tile-based watchlist (2×3 grid) for at-a-glance portfolio monitoring, a detailed modal view with comprehensive stock statistics, real-time ticker editing with API validation, localStorage persistence for user preferences, data freshness indicators showing relative timestamps, and keyboard accessibility (ESC to close, Enter to submit).


The application is built with a professional component architecture split across 8+ modular files, features a cohesive design system with custom typography (Space Grotesk + JetBrains Mono) and a refined financial terminal aesthetic, and implements mobile-first responsive design that works seamlessly across all devices. The result is a production-grade application that demonstrates strong React fundamentals, modern UX best practices, and thoughtful attention to user experience—transforming a simple table requirement into a fully-featured stock dashboard.
