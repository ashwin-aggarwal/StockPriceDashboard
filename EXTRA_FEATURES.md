# Extra Features Beyond Core Requirements

## Core Requirements Completed ✅
- Stock data table with symbol, price, % change
- Tailwind CSS responsive styling
- Finnhub API integration
- Production-ready for deployment

## Additional Features Implemented

This project significantly exceeds the minimum requirements by implementing all five suggested "nice-to-have" features plus several extras. The dashboard includes comprehensive loading states with per-tile spinners, robust error handling with retry functionality and graceful fallbacks, advanced search functionality that filters by both symbol and company name, displaying company logo, multi-column sorting with three-state toggling (ascending/descending/none), and an Open→Current price visualization chart with axes and grid lines. Beyond these, I added an interactive tile-based watchlist (2×3 grid) for at-a-glance portfolio monitoring, a detailed modal view with comprehensive stock statistics, real-time ticker editing with API validation, localStorage persistence for user preferences, and data freshness indicators showing relative timestamps.
